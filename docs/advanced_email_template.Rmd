Subject: Tic-Tac-Toe Project Submission

Hello Professor [Last Name],

I hope you’re doing well. I’m sharing my Tic-Tac-Toe project, which opens in a PyQt5 window with a 3×3 board, a live status message, and clear controls to switch between player-vs-player or player-vs-AI play, adjust the AI difficulty, and reset the match.

The computer opponent relies on a minimax-based strategy: Easy picks a random open spot, Medium looks a few moves ahead, and Hard searches the full game tree so it always makes the best move available.

To try it out, install PyQt5 if it isn’t already on your system, unzip the attached folder, and run `python game.py` to launch the interface.

Thank you for taking the time to review my work. Please let me know if you have any questions or would like any additional information.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
